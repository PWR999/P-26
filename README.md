Ingredients
1 cup self-raising flour (sifted)
1-2 tbs caster sugar
1 egg (lightly beaten)
3/4 cup milk
50 g butter (melted, for frying)


Method

1
In a bowl, beat the egg and then whisk in the milk. Whisk in the sugar (how much you add will depend on how sweet you like your pancakes - don't forget to take toppings into consideration).
2
Sift in the flour and whisk until batter is smooth and lump-free.
3
In a hot pan or flat grill over medium-low heat, brush butter over cooking surface and pour 1/4 cup measures for each pancake.
4
When large bubbles form on the surface, flip the pancake over and cook until lightly golden on the other side. Keep an eye on them as they do cook quickly!

This recipe makes 8 pancakes.
